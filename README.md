# Real-Time Streaming Quality Analyzer

This project leverages machine learning and natural language processing to assess and improve the quality of streaming experiences in real time. It simulates live stream data, predicts user satisfaction using a deep neural network, performs sentiment analysis with BERT, and outputs adaptive Quality of Service (QoS) recommendations.

## 🚀 Features

- **Simulated Live Stream Data**: Generates synthetic metrics like bitrate, buffering, and viewer feedback.
- **User Satisfaction Prediction**: Trained MLP classifier evaluates the likelihood of user satisfaction.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: BERT model detects viewer sentiment from messages (scale 1-5).
- **QoS Decision Engine**: Provides adaptive feedback to improve streaming quality dynamically.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas, NumPy
- PyTorch
- HuggingFace Transformers (BERT)
- MLPClassifier (Deep Neural Network)
- StandardScaler for feature normalization

## 📊 Example Output


🧠 Predicted Satisfaction Probability: 0.78
💬 Sentiment Score (1-5): 4
📡 QoS Decision: ✅ Maintain current QoS.
