# NLP-PROJECT
Logistic Regression-based binary text classifier using TF-IDF features. Includes training, evaluation, and visualization.

# Logistic Regression Text Classifier

This project contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to train a binary text classification model using Logistic Regression and TF-IDF feature extraction.

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `Untitled4.ipynb` â€” Main notebook containing code for preprocessing, training, and evaluating the model.
- `train.csv` â€” Dataset file (should contain `text` and `label` columns).

## ðŸ§  Features

- Preprocess text data with TF-IDF
- Train a logistic regression classifier
- Evaluate the model using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix
- Visualize performance with seaborn heatmaps

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
